# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

## About This Training Course

This repository contains my project implementations from the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course. This comprehensive bootcamp teaches Python programming from beginner to advanced levels through 100 days of hands-on projects, covering the following:

- Python fundamentals and syntax
- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming
- Web development with Flask
- APIs and web scraping
- Data science and automation
- Game development
- GUI applications
- And much more!

Each day folder contains my personal implementation of the course projects, showcasing my learning journey and problem-solving approach.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Use This Repository

### This Parent Folder Has TWO Different Uses:

#### **Use #1: For Git Operations ONLY** 
**When to open:** When you need to commit and push your work to GitHub

**What to do:**
1. Open `100-days-python-journey` in PyCharm
2. You may see a "No Python interpreter configured" warning - **IGNORE IT**
3. Go to **Git → Commit** (Ctrl+K)
4. Select the files you want to commit
5. Write commit message (e.g., "Completed Day 18: Hirst Painting")
6. Click **Commit and Push**
7. **Close this project immediately**

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't try to run any code from this parent folder
- ❌ Don't worry about the interpreter warning
- ❌ Don't install packages here
- ❌ Don't keep this open while coding

---

#### **Use #2: Individual Day Projects for Coding**
**When to open:** When you're actually writing and running code

**What to do:**
1. Open the specific day folder (e.g., `day-018-hirst-painting`) in PyCharm
2. This opens it as its own independent project
3. Code, run, test, and debug normally
4. Each day has its own interpreter and packages
5. When done coding for the day, close this project

**What this means:**
- ✅ Each day folder works independently
- ✅ Has its own virtual environment and packages
- ✅ No conflicts between days
- ✅ Run code normally with right-click → Run

## Quick Reference

| Task | Open This | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Commit to GitHub | Parent folder (`100-days-python-journey`) | Git operations only |
| Write/run code | Individual day folder (e.g., `day-018-hirst-painting`) | Active development |

## Project Structure
```
100-days-python-journey/
├── README.md (this file)
├── day-016-coffee-machine/
│   └── main.py
├── day-017-quiz-game/
│   └── main.py
├── day-018-hirst-painting/
│   └── main.py
└── ... (more days as I progress)
```

Each day folder contains:
- `main.py` - The main Python script
- Other supporting files as needed
- Its own virtual environment (`.venv`) - not tracked by Git

---

## Notes to Self

- Days 1-15 are not included (basic exercises from training files)
- Starting from Day 16 where projects became more substantial
- Each day is a self-contained project
- Remember: Parent = Git container, Individual days = coding workspace
- Don't stress about the interpreter warning in parent folder!
